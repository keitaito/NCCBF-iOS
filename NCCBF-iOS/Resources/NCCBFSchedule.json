        "details": "The name ENSHIN is derived from two Japanese words: â€œenâ€ meaning â€˜open or un nished circleâ€™ and â€œshinâ€ meaning â€˜heartâ€™ or â€˜inner.â€™  e combination of these two words and their meanings embody the most important aspects of Enshin Karate. Established by Grandmaster Kancho Joko Ninomiya in 1988, this style of full contact karate emphasizes taking an opponentâ€™s momentum to reposition oneself for a counterattack. The fighting technique involves kicks, punches, and blocks as well as grabs, throws, and takedowns. \n"
